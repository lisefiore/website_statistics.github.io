At the end of the semester, a final project will be completed by each students. This project aims to combine all the different statistical techniques and R code learnt to analyse real datasets. This project is an individual projects that will evaluate the statistical skills of students. 
Each student will choose a dataset of their choice or from one given in class. Students should conduct analysis in R, write a report, and perform a presentation of their findings. 

## Reports of the final projects

Several outputs are expected from the report:

1. **A background including:**

* Students should propose a **real-world questions** based on datasets chosen. They are expected to justify the real-world **significance** of the question. Some research in the literature might be required (e.g., the state of North Carolina is
investing heavily in developing shellfish aquaculture infrastructure, so interest in shellfish harvest trends is high).

* After identifying the question, students are expected to answer the question.

* Students have to describe the source of the data, measurements, resolution, and any additional information needed to understand the scope and limitations of the data.

2. **A complete analysis of the dataset chosen:**

* Students must explore data analysis including **summary statistics** and **relevant visualizations** that reveal trends in the data. In order to guide the students, at least *three visualizations* will be required.

* Students must conduct at least one hypothesis test that exclude hypotheis testing associated with linear regression. It is expected that they rigorously provide all the scientific and statistical hypotheses. 

* Students must complete a linear regression analysis. They should justify the explanatory variable(s) selected for the analysis. They have to provide diagnostic plots, significance of intercept and coefficient, and a visualization of the modeled and observed data.

3. **Conclusions:**

* Students have to explain the main findings and assess if their analysis answered to their original question.

* They should adress the limitations of their analysis and state how they could improve it (e.g., other data, robustness of the analysis)

      
## Presentation of the final projects

After completion of the written report, students will present their analysis to the entire class.
Students are expected to summarize the background, analysis, and conclusions of their projects. They are expected to show a good understanding of the work performed.
